# consecutive numbers
# this query finds the number that occurs at least 3 times consecutively


select distinct num as ConsecutiveNums from
(select num, id - row_number() over (order by num, id) rank from logs) a # id is basically row numbers so this
group by num, rank                                                       # subtracts the end of the consecutive nums from id
having count(*) >2
