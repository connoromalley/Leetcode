# this problem asks you to swap seats with every 2 positions except for the last one if its odd
# it uses the isnull() function along with lead and lag to swap student ids
# if the id is odd, it replaces it with the next one. if the id is even, it replaces it with the last one
# thus effectively swapping the values
